Program - Different GAN models implementation - 
          1) Vanila GAN, 
          2) Auxiliary Classifier GAN (ACGAN), 
          3) Conditional GAN (CGAN), 
          4) Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN)

Commands to run the program : 

1. Go to Google Colab 
2. Select GPU support in the run time setting 
3. Execute the following command in the cell 
   !python original-GAN.py 
   !python AC_GAN.py 
   !python C_GAN.py 
   !python DC_GAN.py  
   OR
   Copy paste the program content of each program in the cell of Google colab to get the output in an interactive manner.
